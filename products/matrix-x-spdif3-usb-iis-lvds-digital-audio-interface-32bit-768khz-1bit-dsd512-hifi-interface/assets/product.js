After connecting the external power supply, the device will automatically disconnect the USB bus power supply. When connecting the device with low USB output current such as mobile phones and tablets, external power supply is required.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Including</strong><br>\nUSB-B data cable x 1<br>\nWarranty card<br>\nQuick Use Guide</span><br>\n<br>\n<strong><span style="font-size:22px;">Introduce:</span></strong><br>\n<span style="font-size:18px;">The new X-SPDIF3 USB digital audio interface allows your computer, tablet, or mobile phone to easily output high-quality digital audio signals to peripheral digital audio equipment, transmit it asynchronous in USB, and realize from USB to fiber/coaxial/AES/IIS -LVDS output interface conversion. Compared with the previous generation, the IIS-LVDS output isolation is added, and the digital output is completely isolated from the ground line on the USB end to say goodbye to the annoying USB front end interference noise. In addition, the PCM signal of up to 32bit/768kHz, and signal output of 1bit/DSD512. Let you achieve the output quality of high -end digital turntables regardless of the PC and mobile terminals.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Flying-Time <span style="font-size:18px;">Clock</span>:</strong><br>\nEquipped with two Accusilicon Fitzondos Clock as the benchmark clock source, which accurately restores the true music book. In the state of 44.1kHz and 48kHz and its multiple sampling rate, FPGA automatically perform frequency division and switching control, and it is powered by an independent ultra -low noise LDO. The clean power supply allows you to enjoy it.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>IIS-LVDS Interface:</strong><br>\nThere are many output definitions, how to deal with us. Support different definition IIS-LVDS interfaces. The IIS-LVDS interface can be set through the configuration switch of the fuselage as four different output definitions. It is not difficult for back-end products compatible with different standards. Break through the restraint of the rules and explore the meaning of music.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Optional Clock Output Mode:</strong><br>\nThe configuration switch at the bottom of the fuselage can set two different clock output modes to perfectly support different back-end devices. Just move your fingertips gently, and immediately capture the circulation of time, so that Hi-Fi\'s fun tentacles can be obtained.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Realize the Freedom of Encoding Conversion:</strong><br>\nDirectly explore the core and convert it freely. The X-SPDIF3 is equipped with the DOP conversion function, which can convert the dsd dop encoding to DSD Native encoding and output directly from the IIS-LVDS interface, which is unimpeded! Easily realize the freedom of DSD encoding conversion, providing some new fever gameplay for back -end devices that support DSD Native functions.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Support External Power Supply:</strong><br>\nThe USB bus can be used for power supply, at the same time, it has an external power supply interface, and the power supply indicator is also set up intimately. When connecting mobile devices with weak power supply capabilities such as mobile phones and tablets, you can use external linear power supply to power it to ensure that the internal power supply is steadily online. After connecting the external power supply, the device will automatically disconnect the USB bus power supply.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>One-Piece Molding Shell:</strong><br>\nIn order to pursue better electromagnetic shielding performance, the impact of mechanical vibration is minimized. X-SPDIF 3 follows the classic design language of the sound of torque. It uses a full aluminum alloy CNC shell to carefully crafter each design to show the charm of industrial aesthetics. At the same time, the interference noise of the input and output signal across the surrounding device will be escorted to create a pure PC Hi-Fi audio system.</span>',
