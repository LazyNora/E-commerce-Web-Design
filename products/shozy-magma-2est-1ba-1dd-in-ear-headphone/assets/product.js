The pair houses four drivers on each side consisting of two highly-resolving Electrostatic drivers from Sonion, one Knowles BA driver, and one custom-developed dynamic driver unit. These drivers are arranged in a three-way frequency crossover for unmatched sound performance with ultra-low distortion in the output signal.<br><br>Low-Voltage Electrostatic Drivers:<br>Shozy has partnered with Sonion equipping its latest Magma IEMs with dual low-voltage EST drivers from the brand. These EST drivers are known to be highly-resolving tweeters, presenting the users with outstanding extensions and detailing in the high-frequency regions.<br><br>Exceptional Mid-Range Performance With Trusted Knowles BA Driver:<br>Mid-range is handled by a high-performance balanced armature driver from Knowles. It reproduces emotion in our music with lovely rich vocals and beautiful acoustic instruments. With the help of this BA driver, Shozy Magma produces high-resolution clarity with a natural timbre in the mid-range section.<br><br>Custom-Developed Dynamic Driver:<br>Shozy Magma houses a proprietary compound molecule composite membrane dynamic driver unit that produces a powerful lower-end response. The pair has a fast, punchy lower end, where each bass drop is presented with good texture and speed. It complements the other frequencies with its punchy performance.<br><br>Hand-Polished Ear Cavities With Rich Looks:<br>Shozy Magma earpieces have beautiful hand-polished face covers. Each unit has its own unique texture and look. They look exactly like "Magma" with a beautiful combination of Red and Golden tones on the face covers. Shozy has designed the internal acoustic cavity structure using high-precision 3D printing for lower distortion in the output signal.<br><br>High-Purity Cable For Best Sound Performance:<br>In order to bring the best out of the Magma In-Ear Monitors, Shozy has bundled the pair with a high-purity silver-plated copper cable. This cable is designed to enhance the sonic performance and doesn’t introduce any distortion in the signal transmission.</p>\n<p><br></p>',
