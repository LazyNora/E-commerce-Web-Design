It uses XMOS\' latest xCORE-200 series and Xilinx\'s high-performance large-scale PGA chip. The SU-6 is a digital interface using a thermostat-level clock system. Crystek\'s two CCHD-957 femtosecond crystal oscillators provide a solid foundation for the superior audio signal quality of the SU-6 output. The SU-6 digital interface uses a standard USB2.0 input interface, while the SU-6 has a rich output interface, including S/PDI for fiber/coaxial RCA and BNC outputs, AES/EBU for XLR balanced output, RJ45 and HDMI interfaces. Output I2S (including DSD ON signal), clock output supports MCLK main clock and WCLK word clock. The power system design was optimized and the audio section was powered by a 7.5F (7.5 million uf) supercapacitor.<br>\n<br>\nSU-6 is newly developed USB interface, which is positioned at the high-end interface. Compared with previous products, we mainly use the following four new self-developed technologies:<br>\n<br>\n1, built-in CPLD pre-shaping technology, FPGA-based source synchronization technology re-shaping the isolated I2S signal, thus eliminating the additive jitter caused by the isolation chip.<br>\n<br>\n2, the newly designed FPGA algorithm, built-in FIFO buffers the data and then outputs, SPDIF output is re-encoded by FPGA, so that the coaxial output can support PCM 384K and DSD DOP128 at the highest.<br>\n<br>\n3, using CRYSTEK\'s CCHD-957 high-performance femtosecond crystal oscillator, with the self-developed constant temperature system and ultra-low noise super capacitor power supply system, further improve the short-stability performance of the clock.<br>\n<br>\n4. Original single clock system, all circuits of the whole machine adopt synchronous clock design, in which USB clock is synthesized by PLL derived from femtosecond clock.</span></span><br>\n<br>\n<img referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://wxalbum-10001658.image.myqcloud.com/wxalbum/263033/20190909181904/5a2380234d944f4b48b066f85b76dda7.jpg"><br>\n<br>\n<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:16px;"></span><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Technical indicators:</strong></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><br>\nSample rate supported by each output interface:<br>\nPCM: 44.1KHz, 48KHz, 88.2KHz, 96KHz,176.4KHz, 192KHz, 352.8KHz, 384KHz<br>\n<br>\nDSD: 2.8 MHz (DSD64) - DoP, native<br>\n         5.6 MHz (DSD128) - DoP, native<br>\n         11.2 MHz (DSD256) - DoP, native<br>\n         22.5 MHz (DSD512) - native<br>\n<br>\nBit width: up to 32 bit over I2S output<br>\nUp to 24 bit over S/PDI, AES/EBU<br>\n<br>\n<img referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://wxalbum-10001658.image.myqcloud.com/wxalbum/263033/20190909182024/fbbb11df4f8742f74f2873cf291f5d90.jpg"></span></span><br>\n<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Electrical standards for each interface:</strong></span><br>\n<span style="font-size:16px;">1, USB input socket is a standard USB-B type female socket, USB power supply range is 4.5V-5.1V;<br>\n2, DC POWER input socket uses DC2.1 socket, supports 7.5V-9V DC input (for fast charging of super capacitor, power supply requirement is 3A).<br>\n3, BNC interface and RCA interface output standard S / PDI signal, the level is 550mV (connected to standard load), the output impedance is 75 ohms;<br>\n4, XLR interface output standard AES / EBU signal, the level is 3.3V (connected to standard load), the output impedance is 110 ohms;<br>\n5, the word clock (WCLK) output uses BNC interface, the level is TTL (no load), the output impedance is 75 ohms;<br>\nThe 6, 2 HDMI-I2S signals are output through the HDMI socket.
