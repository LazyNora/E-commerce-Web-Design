    '<strong><span style="font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Features:</span></span></strong><span style="font-size:20px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><br>\n2nd Generation Dynamic Driver with W-Shaped Magnesium-aluminium alloy dome.<br>\nDUNU’s patented Nanoporous Amorphous Carbon Coating(Nano DLC).<br>\nDUNU’s patented Air Control Impedance System(ACIS).<br>\nPremium Neodymium Magnet with adjusted tolerances producing a powerful &gt;1.8T Magnetic flux.<br>\nHigh-quality S316 Stainless Steel ear cavities.<br>\nFour-core high-purity Furukawa OCC Copper and Neotech Silver hybrid cable with DUNU’s patented Quick Switch Modular plug system.<br>\nReplaceable Termination plug.<br>\n<br>\nDUNU has announced an upgrade to DUNU Zen its highly-acclaimed single dynamic driver IEMs, behold the brand new DUNU Zen Pro. Explore your music with all new clarity and detail with a newly developed ECLIPSE driver module. It consists of new magnesium and aluminum alloy W-shape driver dome, NanoDLC diaphragm coil, and many more features to provide an immersive experience. DUNU packs the Zen Pro with a high-purity Furukawa OCC Copper and Neotech Silver mixed hybrid cable with their self-patented quick-switch modular plug system. DUNU Zen Pro has been tuned by professionals for an immersive experience!!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>DUNU\'s Revolutionary ECLIPSE Driver Technology:</strong><br>\nDUNU revolutionized its dynamic driver technology with its specially developed ECLIPSE dynamic driver technology. For this, DUNU brings together multiple patented technologies in a single dynamic driver such as full-range response, powerful magnetic flux, metallic alloy dome with high-quality coatings, nano DLC diaphragm, and several other features. Zen Pro is the fourth IEM to feature the revolution ECLIPSE driver technology after DUNU Zen, DUNU Luna, and the latest DUNU Falcon Pro.<br>\n<strong><br>\nRevamped Dynamic Driver For Extra-Ordinary Performance:</strong><br>\nDUNU has upgraded the trusted dynamic driver we had in Zen. The Zen Pro features the 2nd generation W-shaped driver dome with revised metallurgic composition. They have readjusted the magnesium and aluminum alloy composition in the dome metallurgy to provide better rigidity with improved internal damping. Zen Pro has a better treble response with a rich, more natural midrange presentation when compared to the OG DUNU Zen.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>DUNU\'s Patented NanoDLC Diaphragm:</strong><br>\nDLC Diaphragm is a common site in HiFi IEMs. But the DUNU Zen Pro features their patented Nanoporous Amorphous Carbon Diaphragm commonly known as NanoDLC. No, it\'s not nano in size, rather this is among the biggest diaphragm coils you will see in today\'s IEMs. it has the highest ratio of hybridized carbon currently achievable deposited via a high-temperature technology. It has a fine, smooth texture with fewer gaps and surface imperfections. This helps the Zen Pro deliver what it promises, an exceptional listening experience with great clarity and precision.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>DUNU’s Patented Air Control Impedance System(ACIS):</strong><br>\nDUNU Zen Pro is designed by the same professional behind Luna and Zen, Moses XU. It features a similar design to the OG Zen carved out of premium S316 stainless steel material. The earpieces feature DUNU’s self-patented ACIS(Air Control Impedance System) that maintains the air pressure inside the cavity and helps the pair achieve better control in the lower end and at the same time provide a comfortable fit for long listening sessions.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Most Powerful Magnetic Flux In Today\'s Market:</strong><br>\nZen Pro has a specially developed ring-type Neodymium magnet that produces an impressive &gt;1.8T magnetic flux. It is the most powerful magnetic flux you can get in any of today\'s IEMs. Dynamic drivers produce magnetic flux for the swift movement of the diaphragm coil, with such a powerful magnetic flux we can expect high-quality performance with lower distortion as the diaphragm coil moves swiftly inside the driver cavity.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>High-Purity Cable With Patented Swappable Termination Plugs:</strong><br>\nDUNU is among the only few brands that provide brilliant cables with their products. They packed the latest Zen Pro with a four-core high-purity Furukawa OCC Copper+Neotech Silver hybrid cable with their patented Q-Lock Plus patented quick-locking modular plug system. The pair comes bundled with 4.4mm Bal, 2.5mm Bal, and 3.5mm single-ended termination plugs bundled in the package.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Specs:</strong><br>\nImpedance: 16Ω.<br>\nSensitivity: 112±1dB<br>\nFrequency Response Range: 5Hz-40kHz<br>\nTHD+N: &lt;0.2% @ 1kHz</span></span>',
