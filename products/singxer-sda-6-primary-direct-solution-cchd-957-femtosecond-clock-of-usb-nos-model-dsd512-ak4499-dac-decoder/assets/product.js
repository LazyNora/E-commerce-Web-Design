  description:
    '<span style="font-size:16px;">Because the high-end version requires manual adjustment and production, it takes more time to ship. The high-end version adopts a non-loop negative feedback full DC full-balanced discrete class-A output circuit; the crystal oscillator of the USB part uses a CCHD-957 femtosecond clock; the analog part uses a Mondolfo film capacitor for tuning; the sound performance will be better A little more relaxed and lively.<br>\n<br>\nSDA-6 is a high-performance DAC developed by our Singxer team. It uses XMOS’ latest xCORE-200 series chip XU208 as the USB Audio solution and uses AKM’s third-generation flagship DAC: AK4499 as the main chip for digital-to-analog conversion, AK4118 As a digital audio input receiving chip, STM32 is used as the control core of the whole machine, and Xilinx\'s large-scale FPGA is used as the clock system and digital audio stream processing. PCM supports up to 384Khz, DSD adopts native direct solution technology and supports up to DSD512.<br>\n<br>\nThe DAC chip adopts the latest AK4499 released by AKM in 2019; DSD adopts the native direct solution mode. The DSD digital stream does not pass through the internal digital filter and works in the NOS mode, which is fully in line with the design concept of HQPlayer.<br>\n<br>\nIt has a wealth of input and output interfaces, including standard USB2.0 input interface, SPDIF and BNC coaxial and AES balanced input, HDMI-I2S input interface, analog output including XLR balanced output and RCA single-ended output; all interfaces support DSD input.<br>\n<br>\nSDA-6 supports external clock input, among which USB supports 10M clock input, and other interfaces support WCK input. In USB mode, it also supports 50 and 75-ohm switchable input impedance.<br>\n<strong><br>\nMain technical features:</strong><br>\n<br>\n1. Self-developed adaptive clock system technology, built-in 4 independent ultra-low jitter audio crystal oscillators, equipped with a femtosecond-level local clock system for the USB part, the standard version of the crystal oscillator is AS-318B, and the high version is CCHD- 957.<br>\n<br>\n2. High-performance digital-analog hybrid phase-locked loop, excellent clock synchronization recovery technology, can greatly filter the secondary PLL of external digital input jitter.<br>\n<br>\n3. It adopts 4 channels of fully balanced and full DC discrete circuit output; among them, the high-end version adopts non-loop negative feedback output.<br>\n<br>\n4. Large-scale FPGA for digital audio signal processing, self-developed second-generation algorithm, original multi-input channel isolation technology, to ensure the purity of each input signal.<br>\n<br>\n5. Built-in 40 watt custom O-type transformer, output 4 independent power supply windings, up to 20 groups of distributed voltage stabilized circuits; among them, the reference power supply for AK4499 is the newly developed super low noise (as low as 0.5uV RMS) power supply system.<br>\n<br>\nAll versions support 115V and 230V AC voltage switching, and there is a switch inside.<br>\n<strong><br>\nTechnical index:</strong><br>\n<br>\nSampling rate supported by each input interface:<br>\n<br>\nPCM: 44.1KHz, 48KHz, 88.2KHz, 96KHz, 176.4KHz, 192KHz, 352.8KHz, 384KHz<br>\n(USB and I2S support all sampling rates and S/PDIF supports up to 192KHz）<br>\n<br>\nDSD: 2.8 MHz (DSD64)-DoP,native<br>\n<br>\n         5.6 MHz (DSD128)-DoP,native<br>\n<br>\n         11.2 MHz (DSD256)-DoP,native<br>\n<br>\n         22.5792 MHz (DSD512)-native<br>\n（USB and I2S support all DSD formats, S/PDIF, and AES/EBU support DSD64 DOP mode）<br>\n<br>\nBit width: Up to 32 bit over USB and I2S <br>\n                Up to 24 bit over S/PDIF<br>\n<strong><br>\nElectrical standards for each interface:</strong><br>\n<br>\n1. The USB input socket is a standard USB-B type female socket, and the USB power supply range is 4.5V-5.1V.<br>\n<br>\n2. The SPDIF interface inputs standard S/PDIF signals, the input impedance is 75 ohms, and the AES input impedance is 110 ohms.<br>\n<br>\n3. The power input is 115V/230V AC, and a 40-watt customized transformer is used for power supply.<br>\n<br>\n4. I2S input is the LVDS level in the form of the HDMI interface, compatible with most front-end equipment.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Analog output performance:</strong><br>\n<br>\nOutput level (0dBFS):<br>\nPCM: RCA single-ended output is 2.25V RMS, XLR balanced output is 4.5V RMS<br>\nDSD: RCA single-ended output is 1.8V RMS, XLR balanced output is 3.6V RMS<br>\nOutput impedance: 22 ohms (RCA single-ended) / 45 ohms (XLR balanced)<br>\nFrequency response: 20-20kHz +/-0.1dB<br>\nS/N ratio: 131dB (20-22kHz A weighting)<br>\nDistortion characteristics:<br>\nTHD+N (1kHz, 0dBFS) 0.00012% (-118db) at fs=44.1Khz (PCM, 20Hz-22kHz A weighting))<br>\nDynamic response (1kHz, -60dBFS) 131dB (20Hz-22kHz A weighting)<br>\nLeft and right channel separation &gt;130dB @1kHz<br>\n<br>\nNet Weight:2.7KG<br>\nGross Weight:3.6KG<br>\nAccessories: A USB cable<br>\nA power cord<br>\nInfrared remote control</span>',
